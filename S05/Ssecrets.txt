Note: Secrets
Section 5, Lecture 49
In this lecture, we are going to learn how to use secret-backed declaration.

However, In some versions of k8s tools when moving from a variable-based declaration(our previous Volume lecture) to a secret-backed declaration(this lecture) the deployments must be deleted. 

It's strongly suggested to run  below commands to delete all the resources we created previously, restart minikube, before watching this lecture.

# run below commands under the kubernetes-demo/Advanced Kubernetes Usage/Volumes folder.
kubectl delete -f ./mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./wordpress-deployment.yaml
minikube stop
minikube start
