Introduction to Docker Crash course
Section 2, Lecture 4
This Kubernetes course assumes you have a basic understanding of Docker & containers.

If this is not the case, we have prepared a Docker crash course in this section to help you ramp up on Docker. This section is designed to give you a basic overview about Docker and containers so that you can have enough background knowledge to take the rest of the course. This Docker Crash course is instructed by James Lee.

This section covers the following topics:

Install Docker on your your laptop

An overview of Docker architecture

Docker containers / Docker Images / Dockerfiles

Docker Compose

If you already have a basic understanding about Docker and Containers, feel free to skip this section and go straight to the next section about Kubernetes: Introduction to Container Orchestration
