Trouble Shooting
When trying to access the web UI through the serving proxy, It only navigates to show all api paths and not the UI.


Solution:

This is an known issue of the current minikube, tracked on https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3041

To walk round, you are still able to access the minikube dashboard by running:

minikube dashboard

Or using

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy
