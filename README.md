## About the Video Course
Kubernetes is at the cutting-edge of how the greatest apps scale, the most successful businesses ensure reliability day-in and day-out through all kinds of conditions, and how DevOps engineers around the world keep calm and stay effective. After being released as open-source from Google, where Kubernetes remained their "secret-sauce" in their seemingly infinite ability to scale their global-scale products and services without a hitch for almost a decade, Kubernetes + Docker have become the dominant and de facto standard in how applications containerized using technologies such as Docker are architected, deployed, managed, and scaled. If you consider Docker containers in an application as the individual members of an orchestra, each with a specific job and responsibility to stay on-tempo and on-track with the rest of their peers to deliver a great performance, you can think of Kubernetes as the conductor of the orchestra. It's no wonder then that, with its deep history and long track-record managing production applications ranging from small startups to the biggest companies in the world, Kubernetes is the de facto standard in the emerging area of Container Orchestration. From our first simple deployment of a Tomcat container on a local cluster to building a high-availability cluster serving up WordPress on MySQL that can withstand failures of machines, networks, or disks, we walk you through each task and show you not just the how, but also help you understand the why. We cover practical "gotchas" and other pieces of advice that just reading the documentation won't provide. Whether you're a newbie system administrator, an advanced developer, or even a CTO, when you Learn Kubernetes from a DevOps guru you're bound to gain an understanding into the technology that underpins the most well-designed and delivered applications available today. You will go from zero to Kubernetes hero in 5 hours.
